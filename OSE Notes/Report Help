General Info:
The Information Security Analyst (ISA) conducted a social engineering assessment at the {Branch Location}. As a cover story for this location, the ISA posed as an ISP technician troubleshooting network connectivity issues, attempting to gain access to sensitive areas within the facility. The ISA’s purpose as to gain access in the facility without authorization. If the client authorized the visit, the ISA would then test visitor escorting procedures.

Exec Level Statements:
•	No Visitor Escort Policy Enforced – At two locations, the ISA was not escorted throughout the premises and was able to roam freely inside the buildings. In two cases, the analyst was given unsupervised access employee workstations. These workstations were authenticated with employee accounts and given access by the branch managers. While unsupervisored the analyst was able to send emails from the employee’s outlook. This behavior presents risk of data leakage and information disclosure. Visitors to the organization that have been granted access should always be monitored and escorted by authorized personnel . Allowing an individual to travel unescorted could allow a social engineer access to workstations, documentation left on printers and desks, mail, and other sensitive equipment and/or documentation. Additional controls should be in place to detect and prevent this sort of malicious activity. TraceSecurity recommends training users on the dangers of an unescorted visitor in the building, and how to either approach the individual(s) for verification or alert a member of the management team. In addition, creating service accounts for vendors accessing workstations will reduce risk associated with allowing visitors to use employee accounts unsupervised.

•	No Visitor Documentation or Logging – All locations did not require the ISA to fill out any documentation upon arrival. Authorized visitors should be documented with a logbook that collects entry and exit times, purpose of visit, responsible party at the organizations, company represented, and areas accessed during the visit. A visitor badge should also be dawned by the individual to clearly identify and classify the visitor to other members of the organization. TraceSecurity recommends implementing a centralized logging system to track the entry/exit, purpose, organization represented, point of contact during the escort, and areas accessed during the visit.  

•	No Identification Procedures – At all locations, the ISA did not provide any identification for the service being done. Proof of identity should be verified, and cross examined with a government issued ID. Company identification should be collaborated and researched prior to granting visitors authorization to ensure the individual(s) is legitimate. TraceSecurity recommends implementing a vendor/visitor management policy with documentation and escort procedures. Vendor/visitor management policies should include authorized 

Recommendations:
• The location did not record the visit on a visitor log. A visitor log increases accountability and provides valuable information for post-incident investigation. TraceSecurity recommends ensuring that visits to restricted areas arerecorded on a visitor log. This information should include the visitor’s identity, purpose of visit, date/time, authorizing official, and assigned escort.

• The location staff did not escort the ISA for the entire visit. Failure to escort the visitor provided unescorted and unobserved access to communication’s assets, access control systems, and the potential to insert rogue devices or tamper with systems. TraceSecurity recommends ensuring that visitors are escorted and observed at all times in restricted areas.

• The ISA was able to take pictures of sensitive information from within the facility without being noticed. This could allow an attacker to keep records of legible information and sensitive areas of the facility. Under no circumstances should anyone be taking pictures of the facility unless legally and specifically required to do so. Tracesecurity  recommends that unknown individuals taking pictures from within the facility be cross-examined or reported to executive authority.

• The ISA was able to insert removable media into a nearby computer without notice. Allowing the use of removable media by unknown individuals can allow attackers to obtain sensitive information easily from computer systems. Tracesecurity recommends implementing a system that allows monitoring and restrictions for the use of removable media.

• The ISA did not detect any identity verification procedures. Proof of identity should be verified and cross examined with a government issued ID. Company identification should be collaborated and researched prior to granting visitors authorization. TraceSecurity recommends implementing a vendor/visitor management policy with documentation and escort procedures.


Kudos/Unsucessful:
-- During the assessment, the analyst was unable to gain any sensitive information. The Lakewood branch has shown exemplary security posture when dealing with unfamiliar third-party visits and service requests. Tracesecurity recommends to continue practicing proper security awareness procedures by recognizing different visitor types and verifying third party inspections with executive authorization.
