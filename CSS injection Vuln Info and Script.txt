SSLTLS 'CCS Injection' vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224) ----

User Summary
Detects whether a server is vulnerable to the SSL/TLS "CCS Injection" vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224), first discovered by Masashi Kikuchi. The script is based on the ccsinjection.c code authored by Ramon de C Valle (https://gist.github.com/rcvalle/71f4b027d61a78c42607)

In order to exploit the vulnerability, a MITM attacker would effectively do the following:

o Wait for a new TLS connection, followed by the ClientHello ServerHello handshake messages.

o Issue a CCS packet in both the directions, which causes the OpenSSL code to use a zero length pre master secret key. The packet is sent to both ends of the connection. Session Keys are derived using a zero length pre master secret key, and future session keys also share this weakness.

o Renegotiate the handshake parameters.

o The attacker is now able to decrypt or even modify the packets in transit.

The script works by sending a 'ChangeCipherSpec' message out of order and checking whether the server returns an 'UNEXPECTED_MESSAGE' alert record or not. Since a non-patched server would simply accept this message, the CCS packet is sent twice, in order to force an alert from the server. If the alert type is different than 'UNEXPECTED_MESSAGE', we can conclude the server is vulnerable.
