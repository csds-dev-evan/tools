Easy SSL Scanning and Parsing From James ----------

I just placed the files in the /root/ directory. Ex. /root/sslparse/

Create an ssl file that has all of the IP addresses using SSL and their ports (443,587,8443,3889â€¦..) 
Ex.          12.34.56.78:443
                12.34.56.78:3889

Run SSLScan in a for loop to create scan files
for i in $(cat ssl); do sslscan $i | tee scan$i; done

Run sslparse.pl to parse out the files
/root/sslparse/sslparse.pl scan*
